The wild shape ability of the druid class, as well as spells like alter self, animal shapes, polymorph, and shapechange all count as a shapeshift for this purpose, although alternate sources of specific physical traits (for example, a class feature that lets you grow claws) still function.",

Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until the shapeshift ends.",

All other creatures are considered hostiles, regardless of their disposition towards the caster. GMs have the final say in whether or not a character is capable of calling allies.",

You can call multiple creatures with one use of this ability (up to 3 at once) but the combined CR of all called creatures cannot exceed half your level.",
				"{@b Hostiles:} If a hostile creature is unwilling to be called, it is allowed a Wisdom saving throw to resist. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature is not called. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately called.",
				"When a hostile creature is called, it is rooted to a specific location within range (you can decide how much space to give it, up to a 30-foot radius). It cannot leave this area until an agreement with you has been reached. It can escape this location by teleportation or dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma saving throw. It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can do as it pleases including fleeing, returning to its home plane, or attacking you.",
				"If the creature does not break free of its prison, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check contested by the creature’s Charisma check. The check may have advantage based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones re-offered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to dismiss it (a free action so long as it remains trapped). Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you ever roll a natural 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the effect and can escape or attack you.",
				"Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete through its own actions, the effect remains for a maximum of 1 day per level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free (with the same chance to resist as when it was trapped). Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.",
				"{@b Allies:} Allies are never hostile and do not resist, although additional payment is always expected for their services. Payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to a quest on your part that matches the creature’s alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.",
				"As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Non-hazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.",
				"Unlike a companion from the Conjuration sphere that simply returns to its home plane when reduced to 0 hit points, a called creature actually dies when it is killed. If an agreement cannot be reached, the ally returns to their home plane immediately. If you are not willing to give the requested payment, but attempt to press the target into service anyway, treat the creature as hostile. Pressing a creature in this way may have a detrimental effect on any future attempts to call an allied outsider.",
				"At the end of its task, or when the bargained duration expires, a called ally returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible)."

You can only possess a physical creature with a soul (this includes most living creatures and intelligent undead but not constructs or unintelligent undead (those with an Intelligence score of 4 or lower)). The target is immune to any future attempt you make to possess it using the Project Spirit advanced talent for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.",

The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. You cannot choose to activate the body’s special abilities. The creature’s spells and other casting abilities do not stay with the body. Once each round during a possession, the target can spend a Hit Die without spending an action to make an additional Charisma saving throw to end the effect; Creatures that are not controlled by players generally have a number of Hit Dice as determined by their stat block. You can possess a body for up to 1 hour per level, but can always end the effect early as an action. If the host body is reduced to 0 hit points, you return to your body. As is usual when projecting your spirit, this effect can be dispelled at either your body or the host’s body.",
