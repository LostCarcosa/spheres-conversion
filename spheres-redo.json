				"Training in the Alchemy martial sphere teaches you how to quickly and efficiently combine volatile chemicals for new or enhanced effects.",

If you choose poison, you gain proficiency with poisoner’s kits and gain a (poison) talent of your choice. If you are already proficient with the chosen tools, you become proficient with the other tool or gain a bonus talent if you are already proficient with both.", 
				"So long as you have alchemist supplies (for formula) or a poisoner’s kit (for poisons) and are proficient, you are assumed to have all the tools and materials required to create formulae or poisons from the Alchemy sphere; the rest of the ingredients are easily gathered or stored throughout your travels and do not have any default cost. Formulae and poisons that allow a saving throw use your sphere DC.", 
				"You may create formulae and poisons individually or in batches. Creating a formula or poison individually takes 10 minutes, while batches are made as part of a short or long rest. Due to the volatile nature of the items, you cannot have more formulae and poisons created at one time than a number equal to your proficiency bonus + the number of Alchemy sphere talents you possess; formula and poisons go inert after a day if not used. When creating batches, you create up to your maximum number of formulae or poisons. Because formulae and poisons are more unstable than standard alchemical items, they expire and no longer work after 24 hours; it is relatively easy (DC 5 Intelligence check) to recognize that these items’ are unstable and impermanent in nature, so typically they have no monetary value.", 
				"Formulae can be drunk or applied to an adjacent willing ally as an Action. Some formula can also be thrown as an improvised weapon with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. Formulae that are thrown as improvised weapons do not deal damage unless stated otherwise, but do shatter upon impact, applying their effects to the target or object they are thrown against.", 
				"All poisons function as ingested or injury poisons unless modified by another talent. Applying an injury or contact poison to a weapon is an Action, and the next creature that takes damage from that weapon (within 1 minute) suffers its effects. Some formulae can also be applied to weapons, as noted in the relevant talent. You may only have a single formula or poison applied to a weapon at one time; applying another causes the previously applied item to become inert.",

The effects of this increased potency is listed for each individual item. You must have an item’s respective talent to use its more potent form, but you can use this ability not only with formulae and poisons you have created, but also with purchased or crafted items of the same name."

				"Talents marked (followers) grant additional options for your followers. If you have multiple groups of followers, each (followers) talent applies to each of them. Talents marked (sidekick) grant additional options for your sidekick.",
				"The Leadership sphere is different from other Martial spheres because it doesn’t deal with an individual’s abilities, but rather the people they surround themselves with. It is always possible for a Game Master to create an NPC to round out a party or for a team of adventurers to hire some henchmen to assist them, and such things are for the Game Master to decide.",

						"The Leadership sphere, however, reflects characters for whom having followers and sidekicks are not just a passing thing but are instead as integral to their character as their skill with a sword or their knowledge of magic. Maybe you are a noble and keep retainers along as you adventure. Perhaps you are a teacher and are always surrounded by students. Or, maybe you simply have a favorite NPC that, when it comes time for them to part ways with you, you decide to add them to the party as a sidekick rather than see them leave.",
						"As such, the Leadership sphere has some special restrictions that are different from other spheres:",
						"While a Game Master always has the ability to alter the rules to fit a game or a campaign, the Leadership sphere is always only usable with GM permission; some games might just not lend themselves to sidekicks and companions, while some DMs might simply not wish to take upon them the burden of having so many NPCs following the player characters around all the time. Even if the Game Master allows for the Leadership sphere, it is within their right to say that the Leadership sphere cannot be taken until 5th character level; while some characters might begin play with a trusted ally, most adventurers must at least have a reputation before they can begin to attract sidekicks and followers to their cause.",
						"The Leadership sphere and its talents cannot be taken as temporary talents or switchable talents; they cannot be placed inside an armiger’s customized weapon or changed through the Intuitive Combatant feat, etc.. Likewise, players cannot have their conjured companions, animal companions, sidekicks, or anyone other than their actual player characters take the Leadership sphere or talents."

Sidekicks from other publications can be gained through the Leadership sphere, and a GM can always add a sidekick to a party whenever they wish, whether or not a player has gained the Leadership sphere.",
				"When, where, and how a sidekick is gained is up to the Game Master, but they should work with the player to determine the most appropriate choice for the game.",
				"{@b Experience.} Sidekicks and followers are not considered player characters, and so do not get a share of experience points.",
				"{@b Companion Costs.} Because sidekicks and followers gained from the Leadership sphere are ‘purchased’ with talents, they do not cost money to hire, but likewise, they cannot produce money for the players by working jobs on the side unless a specific talent in the Leadership sphere says otherwise. Instead, the cost of hiring, feeding, and equipping these companions, as well as the money they would make from downtime activities, is abstracted; sidekicks are paid in the experience they gain, in the miscellaneous items that they recover and sell that the PCs don’t bother with, and followers make money for the PC on unimportant side jobs, which then goes to cover their payment and upkeep. A player may always give their sidekicks and companions better gear and magic items on their own, but these costs do need to come out of their own pockets.",
				"{@b Loyalty.} Sidekicks and followers are loyal to the player, but no intelligent being will stand being treated poorly. Especially disgruntled sidekicks may work in secret to bring about your downfall.",
				"Also, if a player gets their sidekicks and followers killed, they will begin to have trouble finding others willing to take their place.",
				"Whether or not a sidekick or group of followers is feeling particularly loyal or how they react to rough treatment is determined by the Dungeon Master, but as an optional rule, loyalty can be measured on a scale of 0-20. Sidekicks and followers have a maximum loyalty equal to your Charisma score and a starting loyalty of half that number. If party members act in a manner that runs counter to the sidekick’s alignment or bond, roll 1d4 and subtract that number from their loyalty. This is increased to 2d4 if they are abused, misled, or endangered by the party for purely selfish reasons. Likewise, if the PC treats them especially well, helps them achieve goals tied to their bond, spends their own money on presents and rewards for them, or accomplishes an inspiring deed that makes them feel good about their employment, roll 1d4 and add that number to their loyalty. If loyalty reaches 0, the character is no longer loyal and will either leave or work to undermine the party.",
				"{@b Replacing Sidekicks.} The Leadership sphere assumes that your sidekicks and followers are not temporary hires, but are instead dedicated companions: a knight and his squire, a thieves guild master and his crime family, a scholar and his students, a mercenary captain and his troops, etc.. However, it is possible that either the player wishes to change their sidekick, or that for story reasons the GM has decided to remove them; the squire or intern might graduate or return home to care for their family, etc.. When this happens, the DM and the player should work together to determine where, when, and how a new sidekick is gained in their place. This also can happen if the old sidekick needs to be replaced because they died or left due to low loyalty, but the player might find it difficult to find a new sidekick or group of followers if they have a reputation for poor treatment or of getting sidekicks and followers killed.",
				"{@b Roleplaying Sidekicks and Followers.} Sidekicks and followers are under the control of the player (especially in combat), but this does not mean they are mindless creatures. The Dungeon Master may wish to control the sidekick or even a few key followers (the caravan boss, the head intern, etc.) for roleplay purposes, as they would other important NPCs. If the GM doesn’t wish to voice so many NPCs, an alternative to having one player simply control all of his followers and sidekicks (which can rob the game of fun interactions between characters) is to leave the roleplaying of a player’s sidekicks and followers to the other players around the table, who each might take one important sidekick or follower and play them whenever necessary.",
				"{@b Variant: Party Followers.} In some games, especially those focused on a traveling group larger than a normal adventuring party (such as a caravan, mercenary army, etc.), rather than have one player shoulder the burden of spending character resources to have a group of followers and sidekicks, the party as a whole could be allowed to gain talents. This could be done in various ways, such as allowing each PC to contribute talents into a group pool. One ‘leader’ would take the base sphere while others could add additional talents, reflecting the sidekicks and followers they attract with their skills. Anyone who possesses a (sidekick) talent would be able to use it with any of the shared party sidekicks.",
				"Alternatively, the base sphere could simply be granted to the group, with Persuasion proficiency removed, then additional talents granted at appropriate intervals based on level, achievement, or wealth (either accumulated or spent) to reflect the group’s prestige and influence has achieved through its actions."

If a troop dies completely, all of its members are dead, except perhaps one or two.",

				"Whenever you successfully use Earth-Shattering Slam against a target, you may choose to bury them underground.",
				"The target travels 10 feet through the ground. If this would put the target completely through the ground (such as dropping them through the roof of a building), they fall to the ground below, taking falling damage as normal. If the new ground is still within 10 feet, they may also travel into or through that surface to reach this talent’s limit. This distance increases to 20ft at 17th level.",
				"So long as your Earth-Shattering Slam restrains the target, it also cannot breathe and must hold its breath or begin suffocating. Even if they escape the restraint, they must still climb, fly, or otherwise exit the hole they are in."
